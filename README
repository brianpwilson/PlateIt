=== Welcome to PlateIt

PlateIt is a twitter-esque application with a twist. Most websites require you to
find the person you wish to communicate with by means of a user name or by searching 
through some unique charactertics such as their real name and location, for example
I want to see all Brian P Wilson's in Rochester, NY. PlateIt is actually the reverse
of this identification method.

All cars have a unique identifier. The license plate for each car is unique by state. 
There are no duplicate New York state license plates with the plate id of "WEB1234".
This is the basis by which PlateIt works. 

Messages can be left for each license plate by simply identifing the state and id. A 
message can then be posted to that plate.

Before posting messages the user must register and log in. 

Currently, the last 5 messages that the user posted is displayed. A search for all posts 
by the current user is available as well as a search based on the plate id.

The next time you see a cool car and want to tell the owner, "PlateIt"
Tell them how sweet their paint job is

The next time you see someone backing into and damaging another car, "PlateIt". 
Tell the owner and scoff at the offender

The next time you see a see some good looking members of the opposite sex in a car, "PlateIt"
Maybe you'll get their phone numbers
